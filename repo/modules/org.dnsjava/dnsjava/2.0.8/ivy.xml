        <p>
        dnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java. It supports all defined record types
        (including the DNSSEC types), and unknown types. It can be used for queries, zone
        transfers, and dynamic updates. It includes a cache which can be used by clients,
        and a minimal implementation of a server. It supports TSIG authenticated messages,
        partial DNSSEC verification, and EDNS0.
        </p>
        <p>
        dnsjava provides functionality above and beyond that of the InetAddress class.
        Since it is written in pure Java, dnsjava is fully threadable, and in many cases
        is faster than using InetAddress.
        </p>
        <p>
        dnsjava provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high level functions
        perform queries for records of a given name, type, and class, and return the
        answer or reason for failure. There are also functions similar to those in the
        InetAddress class. A cache is used to reduce the number of DNS queries sent. The
        low level functions allow direct manipulation of DNS messages and records, as
        well as allowing additional resolver properties to be set.
