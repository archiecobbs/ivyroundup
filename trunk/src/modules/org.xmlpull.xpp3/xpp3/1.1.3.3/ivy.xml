            Xml Pull Parser (in short XPP) is a streaming pull XML parser and should be used 
            when there is a need to process quickly and efficiently all input elements (for 
            example in SOAP processors). Pull parsing is just one level up from tokenizing 
            XML (and that is actually how XPP2 default implementation is done). This means 
            that XPP is representing the simplest way of processing XML that you can get 
            (working with tokenizer would be even lower level but is not simple and most of 
            applications would be much more complex to extract useful information from XML 
            tokens ...).
            </p>

            <p>
            With XPP pull parser it is easy to build a next layer on top of it such as standard 
            SAX2 push model (a prototype SAX2 driver for XPP2 is available). Every SAX2 parser 
            has a tokenizer and a pull interface buried inside and XPP2 exposes this layer 
            allowing for faster XML processing - and that is what I wanted to achieve in XPP2 
            and what makes this project interesting.
