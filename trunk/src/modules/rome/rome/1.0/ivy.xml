                ROME is an set of open source Java tools for parsing, generating and publishing RSS
                and Atom feeds. The core ROME library depends only on the JDOM XML parser and supports
                parsing, generating and converting all of the popular RSS and Atom formats including
                RSS 0.90, RSS 0.91 Netscape, RSS 0.91 Userland, RSS 0.92, RSS 0.93, RSS 0.94, RSS 1.0,
                RSS 2.0, Atom 0.3, and Atom 1.0. You can parse to an RSS object model, an Atom object
                model or an abstract SyndFeed model that can model either family of formats.
