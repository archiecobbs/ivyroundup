            I've been working on a small project using <a
            href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>,
            which is a pretty nice framework. However, it's not exactly easy to
            integrate into a normal build environment with ant, as it's based on
            command line utilities.

            After a while, I got tired of it and wrote an <a
            href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> task which can compile GWT modules
            into javascript. I know that others have attempted the same, but as
            far as I could tell, they all required you to hardcode module names in
            build.xml, which is not very nice.

            So, using the task I wrote, it's possible to generate javascript for
            a set of modules using a single task. Plus, it's a little faster when
            compiling more modules, as it doesn't have to restart the compiler
            completely every time.

            Try it out. It's released under a GPL license.
