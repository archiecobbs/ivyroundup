        <description homepage="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">
            Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write
            Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the
            process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring
            (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that
            want to enforce a coding standard.

            Checkstyle is highly configurable and can be made to support
            almost any coding standard. An example configuration file
            is supplied supporting the Sun Code Conventions. As well,
            other sample configuration files are supplied for other
            well known conventions.
