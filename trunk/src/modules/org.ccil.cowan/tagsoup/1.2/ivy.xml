        <description homepage="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">TagSoup is a SAX-compliant parser written in Java that, instead of parsing
            well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as it is found in the wild: poor, nasty and brutish, though quite often far from
            short. TagSoup is designed for people who have to process this stuff using some semblance of a rational application
            design. By providing a SAX interface, it allows standard XML tools to be applied to even the worst HTML. TagSoup also
            includes a command-line processor that reads HTML files and can generate either clean HTML or well-formed XML that is
            a close approximation to XHTML.
