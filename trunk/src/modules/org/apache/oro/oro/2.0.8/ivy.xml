            The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java
            classes that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions,
            AWK-like regular expressions, glob expressions, and
            utility classes for performing substitutions, splits,
            filtering filenames, etc. This library is the successor to
            the OROMatcher, AwkTools, PerlTools, and TextTools libraries
            originally from ORO, Inc. Despite little activity in the form
            of new development initiatives, issue reports, questions,
            and suggestions are responded to quickly.
