            <p>
            Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into
            their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string
            to an equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects
            including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to
            JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in
            your classes something that you can not do if you do not have access
            to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java
            Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.
            </p>

            <p>
            Gson Goals:
            <ul>
            <li>Provide simple <code>toJson()</code> and <code>fromJson()</code> methods to convert Java objects to
                JSON and vice-versa</li>
            <li>Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON</li>
            <li>Extensive support of Java Generics</li>
            <li>Allow custom representations for objects</li>
            <li>Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
