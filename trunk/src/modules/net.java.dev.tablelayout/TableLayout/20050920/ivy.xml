         TableLayout is a totally free layout manager designed to make creating
         user interfaces fast and easy. It can do anything GridBagLayout can do
         and much, much more. Yet it is remarkably simple and easy to use.

         TableLayout uses concepts that everyone is familiar with such as
         spreadsheet-like rows, columns, and cells; and word processing
         justifications like left, center, right, and full. Consequentially,
         creating interfaces takes minutes instead of hours. Read the tutorial
         articles below to quickly get familiar with TableLayout. Once you do,
         you will never want to use another layout manager again!
