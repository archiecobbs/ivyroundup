                The Java Persistence API simplifies the programming model for entity
                persistence and adds capabilities that were not in EJB 2.1. Here's a
                quick list of its simplifications and additions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Requires fewer classes and interfaces</li>
                    <li>Virtually eliminates lengthy deployment descriptors through annotations</li>
                    <li>Addresses most typical specifications through annotation defaults</li>
                    <li>Provides cleaner, easier, standardized object-relational mapping</li>
                    <li>Eliminates the need for lookup code</li>
                    <li>Adds support for inheritance, polymorphism, and polymorphic queries.</li>
                    <li>Adds support for named (static) and dynamic queries.</li>
                    <li>Provides a Java Persistence query language -- an enhanced EJB QL</li>
                    <li>Makes it easier to test entities outside of the EJB container</li>
                    <li>Can be used outside of the container</li>
                    <li>Can be used with pluggable, third-party persistence providers</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
