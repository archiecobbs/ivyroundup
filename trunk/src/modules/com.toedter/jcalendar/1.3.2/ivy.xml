        JCalendar is a Java date chooser bean for graphically picking a date.
        JCalendar is composed of several other Java beans, a JDayChooser, a
        JMonthChooser and a JYearChooser. All these beans have a locale
        property, provide several icons (Color 16x16, Color 32x32, Mono
        16x16 and Mono 32x32) and their own locale property editor. So they
        can easily be used in GUI builders. Also part of the package is a
        JDateChooser, a bean composed of an IDateEditor (for direct date
        editing) and a button for opening a JCalendar for selecting the date.
