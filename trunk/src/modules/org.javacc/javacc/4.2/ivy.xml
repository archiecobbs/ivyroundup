            Java Compiler Compiler [tm] (JavaCC [tm]) is the most popular parser generator for use with 
            Java [tm] applications. A parser generator is a tool that reads a grammar specification and 
            converts it to a Java program that can recognize matches to the grammar. In addition to the 
            parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilities related to parser 
            generation such as tree building (via a tool called JJTree included with JavaCC), actions, 
            debugging, etc.
