            <p>
            <b>Vaadin is a web application framework for Rich Internet
            Applications (RIA).</b> In contrast to Javascript libraries and
            browser-plugin based solutions, it features a server-side
            architecture, which means that the largest part of the logic
            runs on the server. Ajax technology is used on the browser side
            to ensure a rich and interactive user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Vaadin is a large collection of UI components.</b>  You compose the
            application user interface from components such as the Button,
            Table and Tree. The components use events, listeners and data
            binding to communicate with each other and with your business
            logic.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Vaadin is a robust architecture for rapid application
            development.</b> The component-based architecture together with the
            data binding features help you build applications that are easily
            modularized and refactored as needed.
