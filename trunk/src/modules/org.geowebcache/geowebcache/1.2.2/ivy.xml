                GeoWebCache is a Java web application used to cache map tiles coming from a variety of sources such as
                OGC Web Map Service (WMS). It implements various service interfaces (such as WMS-C, WMTS, TMS, Google
                Maps KML, Virtual Earth) in order to accelerate and optimize map image delivery. It can also recombine
                tiles to work with regular WMS clients.
