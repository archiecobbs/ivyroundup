        The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) encapsulates as simple tags the core functionality
        common to many Web applications. JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as iteration
        and conditionals, tags for manipulating XML documents, internationalization tags, and SQL tags.
        It also provides a framework for integrating existing custom tags with JSTL tags.
