        <description homepage="http://ws.apache.org/xmlschema/">XMLSchema is a
        lightweight Java object model that can be used to manipulate and generate XML schema
        representations. You can use it to read XML Schema (xsd) files into memory and analyze
        or modify them, or to create entirely new schemata from scratch.</description>
