                Jakarta Regexp is a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package that was graciously donated
                to the Apache Software Foundation by Jonathan Locke. He originally wrote this software back
                in 1996 and it has stood up quite well to the test of time. It includes complete Javadoc
                documentation as well as a simple applet for visual debugging and testing suite for compatibility.
