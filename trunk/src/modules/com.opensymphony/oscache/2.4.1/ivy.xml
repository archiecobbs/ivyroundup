            OSCache is a caching solution that includes a JSP tag library
            and set of classes to perform fine grained dynamic caching
            of JSP content, servlet responses or arbitrary objects. It
            provides both in memory and persistent on disk caches, and
            can allow your site to have graceful error tolerance (eg if an
            error occurs like your db goes down, you can serve the cached
            content so people can still surf the site almost without knowing).
