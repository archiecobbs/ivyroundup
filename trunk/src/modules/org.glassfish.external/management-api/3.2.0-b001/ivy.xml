            The Grizzly NIO framework has been designed to help developers to take advantage of the Java NIO API. 
            Grizzly's goal is to help developers to build scalable and robust servers using NIO as well as offering 
            extended framework components: Web Framework (HTTP/S), WebSocket, Comet, and more!
