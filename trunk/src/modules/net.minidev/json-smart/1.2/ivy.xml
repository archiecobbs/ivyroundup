                JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
                It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
                It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition
                - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses
                conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#,
                Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
                These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
