            EMS is the connection library behind MC4J. It is an adapter layer to allow simultaneous 
            access to any number of MBean servers from different AS vendors and different versions of 
            those. It uses classloading isolation per connection to avoid the typical serialization 
            problems and can load the correct libraries from installations of the target app servers. 
            It also provides a cached, object form of the MBeanInfo metadata that eases writing tools 
            that connect to many MBean Servers.
