The util.concurrent package by Doug Lea provides standardized, efficient versions of utility classes commonly encountered in concurrent Java programming. 
Note: Upon release of J2SE 5.0, this package enters maintenance mode: Only essential corrections will be released. J2SE5 package java.util.concurrent includes improved, more efficient, standardized versions of the main components in this package.
