                The Java Authorization Contract for Containers (Java ACC) specification
                (JSR-115) defines new java.security.Permission classes to satisfy the
                Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) authorization model. The Java
                ACC specification defines the binding of container access decisions to
                operations on instances of these permission classes. It defines the
                semantics of policy providers that employ the new permission classes to
                address the authorization requirements of J2EE, including the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    The definition of roles as named collections of permissions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The granting to principals of permissions corresponding to roles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The determination of whether a principal has been granted the
                    permissions of a role (ie. isCallerInRole)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The definition of identifier to role mappings that bind
                    application embedded identifiers to application scoped role names
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Java ACC specification defines the installation and configuration
                of authorization providers for use by containers. The specification
                defines the interfaces that a provider must make available to allow
                container deployment tools to create and manage permission collections
                corresponding to roles.
