            The Java Message Service (JMS) API is a messaging standard
            that allows application components based on the Java 2
            Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) to create, send, receive,
            and read messages. It enables distributed communication that
            is loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.

            <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b>You must download the JMS software yourself from
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/docs.html">Sun's web site</a>
            after agreeing to the license terms. Once you've downloaded the JAR,
            save it as <code>${java.io.tmpdir}/jms-1_1-fr-apidocs.zip</code>,
            where it will be picked up by this module's packager.xml file.
