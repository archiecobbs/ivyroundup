        <p>
        XMLBeans is a technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types. XMLBeans
        provides several ways to get at the XML, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Through XML schema that has been compiled to generate Java types that represent
            schema types. In this way, you can access instances of the schema through
            JavaBeans-style accessors after the fashion of "getFoo" and "setFoo".
            <p>
            The XMLBeans API also allows you to reflect into the XML schema itself
            through an XML Schema Object model.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>A cursor model through which you can traverse the full XML infoset.</li>
            <li>Support for XML DOM.</li>
        </ul>
