             Jaxen is an open source XPath library written in Java. It
             is adaptable to many different object models, including DOM,
             XOM, dom4j, and JDOM. Is it also possible to write adapters
             that treat non-XML trees such as compiled Java byte code or
             Java beans as XML, thus enabling you to query these trees
             with XPath too.
