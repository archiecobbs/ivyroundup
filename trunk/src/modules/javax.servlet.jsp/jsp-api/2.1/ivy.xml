        JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology enables Web developers and designers
            to rapidly develop and easily maintain, information-rich, dynamic
            Web pages that leverage existing business systems. As part of the
            Java technology family, JSP technology enables rapid development of
            Web-based applications that are platform independent. JSP technology
            separates the user interface from content generation, enabling
            designers to change the overall page layout without altering the
            underlying dynamic content.
