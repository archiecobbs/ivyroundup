            The XML Security project is aimed at providing implementation
            of security standards for XML. Currently the focus is on the
            W3C standards :
            <ul>
            <li>XML-Signature Syntax and Processing; and</li>
            <li>XML Encryption Syntax and Processing.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            Once these are implemented, XML Key Management is likely to be
            the next focus for the project.
            </p>

            <p>
            Two libraries are currently available.
            <ol>
            <li>A Java library, which includes a mature Digital Signature
            implementation. Encryption is currently under development.</li>
            <li>A C++ library is also now available. Functionality is
            currently more basic than that provided by the Java library.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
