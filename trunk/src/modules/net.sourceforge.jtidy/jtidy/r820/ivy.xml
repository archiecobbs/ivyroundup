            <p>
            JTidy is a Java port of <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy</a>,
            a HTML syntax checker and pretty printer. Like its non-Java
            cousin, JTidy can be used as a tool for cleaning up malformed
            and faulty HTML. In addition, JTidy provides a DOM interface
            to the document that is being processed, which effectively
            makes you able to use JTidy as a DOM parser for real-world
            HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
            JTidy was written by Andy Quick, who later stepped down from
            the maintainer position. Now JTidy is maintained by a group
            of volunteers.
            </p>
