            <p>
            Animate any component, even sub-windows with a small set of usable animations.
            </p>

            <p>
            The AnimatorProxy is an invisible component that animates
            other components directly, without additional component
            hierarchy or DOM element overhead. In principal, you only
            need one AnimatorProxy in your application, and you can then
            animate any other components in that same application: size,
            position, fading and rolling/curtaining.
            </p>

            <p>
            The AnimatorProxy also provides a convenient listener
            mechanism for all animations that are run through it,
            allowing you to make actions after an animation has finished.
            </p>

            <p>
            See the <a
            href="http://jouni.virtuallypreinstalled.com/Animator">online
            demo</a> for available animation types and examples.
            </p>

            <p>
            All animations allow you to specify the duration and delay of
            the animation. The animations are atomic, so they won't repeat
            automatically each time the user reloads the application.
            </p>

            <p>
            This version is for Vaadin 6.
