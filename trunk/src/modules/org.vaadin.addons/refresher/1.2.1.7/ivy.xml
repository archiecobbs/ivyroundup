            <p>
            Because of the way Vaadin works, asynchronous UI changes made
            on the server side (e.g. by a long-duration data processing
            Thread) aren't reflected to the client side. This component
            makes it possible to make UI changes, even if the user
            doesn't start a transaction.
            </p>

            <p>
            This version is for Vaadin 7.
