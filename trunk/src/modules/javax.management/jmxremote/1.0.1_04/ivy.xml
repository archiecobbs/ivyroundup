            JMX technology provides the tools for building distributed,
            Web-based, modular and dynamic solutions for managing
            and monitoring devices, applications, and service-driven
            networks. By design, this standard is suitable for adapting
            legacy systems, implementing new management and monitoring
            solutions, and plugging into those of the future.
            </p>
