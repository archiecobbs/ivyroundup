            <p>
            jBCrypt is a Java implementation of OpenBSD's Blowfish
            password hashing code, as described in "A Future-Adaptable
            Password Scheme" by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res.
            </p>

            <p>
            This system hashes passwords using a version of Bruce
            Schneier's Blowfish block cipher with modifications designed
            to raise the cost of off-line password cracking and frustrate
            fast hardware implementation. The computation cost of
            the algorithm is parametised, so it can be increased as
            computers get faster. The intent is to make a compromise of
            a password database less likely to result in an attacker
            gaining knowledge of the plaintext passwords (e.g. using
            John the Ripper).
