        HSQLDB is the leading SQL relational database engine written in Java. It
        has a JDBC driver and supports a rich subset of ANSI-92 SQL (BNF tree
        format) plus SQL 99 and 2003 enhancements. It offers a small (less than
        100k in one version for applets), fast database engine which offers both
        in-memory and disk-based tables and supports embedded and server modes.
        Additionally, it includes tools such as a minimal web server, in-memory
        query and management tools (can be run as applets) and a number of
        demonstration examples.
