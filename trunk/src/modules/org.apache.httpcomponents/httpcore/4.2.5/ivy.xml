        <p>
            HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components
            that can be used to build custom client and server side
            HTTP services with a minimal footprint.
        </p>

        <p>
            HttpCore is a set of components implementing the most
            fundamental aspects of the HTTP protocol that are
            nonetheless sufficient to develop full-featured client-side
            and server-side HTTP services with a minimal footprint.
        </p>

        <p>
            HttpCore has the following scope and goals:
            <ol>
            <li>HttpCore Scope
                <ul>
                    <li>A consistent API for building client / proxy / server side HTTP services</li>
                    <li>A consistent API for building both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP services</li>
                    <li>A set of low level components based on blocking (classic) and non-blocking (NIO) I/O models</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>HttpCore Goals
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementation of the most fundamental HTTP transport aspects</li>
                    <li>Balance between good performance and the clarity and expressiveness of API</li> 
                    <li>Small (predictable) memory footprint</li>
                    <li>Self contained library (no external dependencies beyond JRE)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What HttpCore is NOT
                <ul>
                    <li>A replacement for HttpClient</li>
                    <li>A replacement for a Servlet container or a competitor to the Servlet API</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
