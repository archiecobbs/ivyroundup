        DbUnit is a JUnit extension (also usable with Ant) targeted for
        database-driven projects that, among other things, puts your
        database into a known state between test runs. This is an excellent
        way to avoid the myriad of problems that can occur when one test case
        corrupts the database and causes subsequent tests to fail or
        exacerbate the damage.
