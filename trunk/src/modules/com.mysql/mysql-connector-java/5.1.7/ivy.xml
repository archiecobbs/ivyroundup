            MySQL Connector/J is a native Java driver that converts JDBC
            (Java Database Connectivity) calls into the network protocol
            used by the MySQL database. It lets developers working with
            the Java programming language easily build programs and
            applets that interact with MySQL and connect all corporate
            data, even in a heterogeneous environment. MySQL Connector/J
            is a Type IV JDBC driver and has a complete JDBC feature
            set that supports the capabilities of MySQL.
