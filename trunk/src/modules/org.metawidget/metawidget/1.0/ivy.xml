            <p>
                Metawidget is a 'smart User Interface widget' that populates itself, at runtime, with UI components to match the
                properties of your business objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Metawidget does this without introducing new technologies. It inspects your existing back-end architecture (such as
                JavaBeans, existing annotations, existing XML configuration files) and creates widgets native to your existing
                front-end framework (such as Swing, Java Server Faces, Struts, Android).
            </p>
            <p>
                Metawidget does not replace or hide your existing UI framework and guarantees that your investment in its
                technology and knowledge is as valid as always. The LGPL Open Source license allows the use of Metawidget in open
                source and commercial projects.
