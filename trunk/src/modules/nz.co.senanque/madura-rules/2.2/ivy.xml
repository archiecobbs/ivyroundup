        This is a plugin to Madura Objects. It provides a rules/constraint engine to assist with validation,
        deriving new values from user inputs (eg total of invoices entered on this customer) an manipulating metadata
        (eg because the amount is above X we make some field readonly). Note that the Java that is using the
        monitored objects is quite unaware of the rules layer implemented here. That means you can change rules
        without having to go back to your Java code, and it also means you don't have to wonder if everything
        implemented the same rules. Anything using that Java object has the rules (unless you turn them all off).
