            Java Transaction API (JTA) specifies standard Java interfaces
            between a transaction manager and the parties involved in
            a distributed transaction system: the resource manager,
            the application server, and the transactional applications.
            </p>

            <p>
            The JTA specification was developed by Sun Microsystems in
            cooperation with leading industry partners in the transaction
            processing and database system arena. See <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=907">JSR 907</a>.
            Also see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/jts">Java Transaction Service (JTS)</a> page.
