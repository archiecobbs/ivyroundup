            <p>
            the XXIndex library is originally a part of the PSI-Dev project. It
            aims at addressing the needs for quick data retrieval in large XML
            files. The key features of the library include:
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to Use: XXIndex uses XPath-like expressions to identify XML entities.</li>
                <li>Small Memory Footprint: Unlike some XML indexing libraries,
                    XXIndex does not require to load the whole file into memory (large
                    or small). Only the indices are stored in order to achieve minimum
                    memory requirement.</li>
                <li>Quick Indexing: Although the speed of indexing
                    depends on the complexity of the input XML file (the higher the XML
                    tag density the slower the indexing), based on our experience, a
                    500MB XML file usually takes only around 50 seconds.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
