The CSS Parser is implemented as a package of Java classes, that inputs Cascadin
g Style Sheets Level 2 source text and outputs a Document Object Model Level 2 S
tyle tree. Alternatively, applications can use SAC: The Simple API for CSS. Its 
purpose is to allow developers working with Java to incorporate Cascading Style 
Sheet information, primarily in conjunction with XML application developments.
