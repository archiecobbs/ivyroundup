            JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
            format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for
            machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the
            JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition -
            December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language
            independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers
            of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,
            JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make
            JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

            JSON is built on two structures:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages,
                    this is realized as an object, record, struct,
                    dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is
                    realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern
            programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes
            sense that a data format that is interchangable with programming
            languages also be based on these structures.
