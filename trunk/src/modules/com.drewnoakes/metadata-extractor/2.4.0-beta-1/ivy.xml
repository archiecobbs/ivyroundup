        <description homepage="http://www.drewnoakes.com/code/exif/">
            <p>What began as a simple utility to extract the date-taken from a digital still
               camera (DSC) Jpeg file is now a general metadata extraction framework. Support
               currently exists for Exif and Iptc metadata segments. Extraction of these segments
               is provided for Jpeg files. It is hoped that individuals with specific needs will
               extend the framework by adding their own classes.</p>

            <p>Information extracted by this library might be of use to you if you're writing an
               image browser, image categoriser, photo album, etc... I started coding this library
               for use in my own photo gallery.</p>

            <p>This is the only Java based Exif extraction library I know of.</p>


            <p>This metadata library is available with Java source code for usage in the public domain.</p>
