        <description homepage="http://fastutil.di.unimi.it/">
            fastutil extends the Java Collections Framework by providing type-specific
            maps, sets, lists and queues with a small memory footprint and fast
            access and insertion; provides also big (64-bit) arrays and lists and fast,
            practical I/O classes for binary and text files.
