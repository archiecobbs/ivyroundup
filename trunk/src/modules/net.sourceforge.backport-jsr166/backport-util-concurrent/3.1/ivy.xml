        This package is the backport of java.util.concurrent API, introduced in
        Java 5.0 and further refined in Java 6.0, to older Java platforms. The
        backport is based on public-domain sources from the JSR 166 CVS
        repository, the dl.util.concurrent package, and the Doug Lea's
        collections package.
