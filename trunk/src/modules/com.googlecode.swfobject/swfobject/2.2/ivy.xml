            <p>
            SWFObject (originally FlashObject]) is an open-source
            JavaScript library used to embed Adobe Flash content onto
            Web pages, which is supplied as one small JavaScript file.
            The library can also detect the installed Adobe Flash Player
            plug-in in all major web browsers, on all major operating
            systems (OS), and can redirect the visitor to another webpage
            or show alternate HTML content if the installed plug-in is
            not suitable.
            </p>
