            <p>
            Diff Utils library is an OpenSource library for performing the comparison
            operations between texts: computing diffs, applying patches, generating
            unified diffs or parsing them, generating diff output for easy future
            displaying (like side-by-side view) and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
            Main reason to build this library was the lack of easy-to-use
            libraries with all the usual stuff you need while working with diff
            files. Originally it was inspired by JRCS library and it's nice design
            of diff module.  Main Features:

            <ul>
            <li>Computing the difference between two texts.</li>
            <li>Capable to hand more than plain ASCII. Arrays or List of any type
            that implements hashCode() and equals() correctly can be subject to
            differencing using this library</li>
            <li>Patch and unpatch the text with the given patch</li>
            <li>Parsing the unified diff format</li>
            <li>Producing human-readable differences </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Algorithms</b>
            </p>

            <p>
            This library implements Myer's diff algorithm. But it can easily replaced
            by any other which is better for handing your texts. I have plan to add
            implementation of some in future.
