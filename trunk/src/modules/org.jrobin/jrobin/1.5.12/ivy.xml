        <p>
        <b>JRobin is a 100% pure java implementation of RRDTool's functionality.
        </b> It follows the same logic and uses the same data sources, archive 
        types and definitions as RRDTool does. JRobin supports all standard 
        operations on Round Robin Database (RRD) files: CREATE, UPDATE, FETCH, 
        LAST, DUMP, XPORT  and GRAPH. JRobin's API is made for those who are 
        familiar with RRDTool's concepts and logic, but prefer to work with pure 
        java. If you provide the same data to RRDTool and JRobin, you will get 
        exactly the same results and graphs. JRobin is made from the scratch and 
        it uses very limited portions of RRDTool's original source code. JRobin 
        does not use native functions and libraries, has no Runtime.exec() calls 
        and does not require RRDTool to be present.
