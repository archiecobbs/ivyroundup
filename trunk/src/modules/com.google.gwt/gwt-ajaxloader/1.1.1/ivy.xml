            The Google API Libraries for Google Web Toolkit is a
            collection of libraries that provide Java language bindings
            for popular Google JavaScript APIs. These libraries make it
            quick and easy for developers to use these Google JavaScript
            APIs with Google Web Toolkit. The libraries are supported
            by the Google Web Toolkit team.

            The AjaxLoader project is intendend for loading Google
            AJAX Apis and isn't of much use by itself. The AjaxLoader
            class allows a GWT application to dynamically configure
            load options such as the locale and API key at run time,
            instead of delegating these functions to the host HTML page.
