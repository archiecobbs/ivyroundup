            <b>msrp4j</b> is a Java library for the MSRP protocol defined by
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4975">RFC 4975</a>.
            MSRP is a TCP protocol for transmitting messages containing arbitrary
            content between peers. MSRP can be thought of as a TCP/IP version
            of SMS/MMS text messaging.

            <b>msrp4j</b> implements the actual MSRP protocol itself. The setup and/or
            negotiation of MSRP sessions must be handled by other means, for
            example, via SIP.

            <b>msrp4j</b> also includes an executable command line test client.
