            <p>
            The <b>jibx-bindings</b> project seeks to provide a library of Java
            classes and their corresponding pre-compiled JiBX bindings
            for various common public XML document formats.
            </p>

            <p>
            By including JiBX along with the appropriate pre-compiled
            binding JARs from <b>jibx-bindings</b>, your application is all
            set up for fast and efficient conversion between XML and Java.
            </p>

            <p>
            While the pre-compiled concrete bindings in <b>jibx-bindings</b>
            provide immediately usable code, all of the binding modules
            in <b>jibx-bindings</b> are designed using modular abstract mapping
            definitions, so you can easily define new bindings that
            pull from existing XML schemas simply by including these
            definitions in your own binding.
            </p>

            <p>
            Unlike bindings auto-generated from XSD schema files,
            <b>jibx-bindings</b> Java classes and JiBX binding files are all
            hand crafted and developer friendly, based on the principle
            that the Java object is primary, while the XML document is
            just an expression of it.
            </p>
