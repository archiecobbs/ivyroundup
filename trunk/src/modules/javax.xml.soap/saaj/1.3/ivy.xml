        JavaTM (SAAJ) 1.3 provides the API for creating and sending SOAP messages by means of the
        javax.xml.soap package. It is used for the SOAP messaging that goes on behind the scenes in
        JAX-RPC, and JAXR implementations. SOAP Handlers in JAX-WS use SAAJ APIs to access the SOAP
        Message.  Developers can also use it to write SOAP messaging applications directly instead of
        using JAX-RPC/JAX-WS.]]></description>
