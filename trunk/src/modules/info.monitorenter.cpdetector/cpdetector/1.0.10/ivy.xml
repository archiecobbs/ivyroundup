            <p>
            The name <b>cpdetector</b> is a short form for code
            page - detector and has nothing to do with java classpaths.
            <b>cpdetector</b> is a framework for configurable code
            page-detection of documents. It may be used to detect
            the code page of documents retrieved from remote hosts.
            Code page - detection is needed whenever it is not
            known, which encoding a document belongs to. Therefore
            it is a core requirement for any application in the
            field of information mining or just information retrieval.
