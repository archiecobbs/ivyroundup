            <p>
            The standard Java libraries fail to provide enough methods
            for manipulation of its core classes. Apache Commons Lang
            provides these extra methods.
            </p>

            <p>
            Lang provides a host of helper utilities for
            the java.lang API, notably String manipulation methods,
            basic numerical methods, object reflection, concurrency, creation and
            serialization and System properties. Additionally it contains
            basic enhancements to
            java.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help
            with building methods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note that Lang 3.0 (and subsequent versions) use a different package
            (org.apache.commons.lang3) than the previous versions
            (org.apache.commons.lang), allowing it to be used at the same time
            as an earlier version.
