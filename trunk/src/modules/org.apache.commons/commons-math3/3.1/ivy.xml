        <p>
        Commons Math is a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common problems not available in the Java programming language or Commons Lang.
        </p>

        <p>
        Guiding principles:
        <ol>
            <li>Real-world application use cases determine development priority.</li>
            <li>This package emphasizes small, easily integrated components rather
                than large libraries with complex dependencies and configurations.</li>
            <li>All algorithms are fully documented and follow generally accepted best practices.</li>
            <li>In situations where multiple standard algorithms exist, a Strategy pattern
                is used to support multiple implementations.</li>
            <li>Limited dependencies. No external dependencies beyond Commons components
                and the core Java platform (at least Java 1.3 up to version 1.2 of the library,
                at least Java 5 starting with version 2.0 of the library).</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
