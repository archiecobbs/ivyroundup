        Java Uuid Generator (JUG) is a pure java UUID generator, that can be used either as a component in a 
        bigger application, or as a standalone command line tool (similar to Unix 'uuidgen'). UUIDs are 128-bit 
        Universally Unique IDentifiers (aka GUID, Globally Unique IDentifier used in Windows world). 
        </p>
        <p>
        JUG is an open-source library that generates UUIDs according to the IETF UUID specification (and further 
        clarified in UUID URN name space IETF draft). It specifically supports all 3 'official' types defined 
        by the draft, unlike most (all?) other Java alternatives.
        </p>

        You can use JUG in your application according to the license terms of either:
