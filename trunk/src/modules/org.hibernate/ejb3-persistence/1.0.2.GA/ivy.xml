        The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture is a component architecture for
        the development and deployment of component-based business
        applications. The purpose of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.0 is to
        improve the EJB architecture by reducing its complexity from the
        developer's point of view.
