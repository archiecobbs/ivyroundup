            <p>
                JPA 2 defines a new typesafe Criteria API which allows criteria queries to be constructed in a
                strongly-typed manner, using metamodel objects to provide type safety. For developers it is important
                that the task of the metamodel generation can be automated. Hibernate Metamodel Generator is an
                annotation processor based on the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=269">Pluggable Annotation
                Processing API</a> with the task of creating JPA 2 static metamodel classes.
