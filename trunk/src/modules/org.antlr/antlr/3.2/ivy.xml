            ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly
            PCCTS) is a language tool that provides a framework for
            constructing recognizers, compilers, and translators
            from grammatical descriptions containing Java, C#, C++,
            or Python actions. ANTLR provides excellent support for
            tree construction, tree walking, and translation. There are
            currently about 5,000 ANTLR source downloads a month.
