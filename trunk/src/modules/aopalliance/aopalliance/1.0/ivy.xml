            The AOP Alliance project is a joint open-source project
            between several software engineering people who are interested
            in AOP and Java.

            We believe that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers
            a better solution to many problems than do existing
            technologies such as EJB. AOP Alliance intends to facilitate
            and standardize the use of AOP to enhance existing middleware
            environments (such as J2EE), or development environements
            (e.g. JBuilder, Eclipse). The AOP Alliance also aims to ensure
            interoperability between Java/J2EE AOP implementations to
            build a larger AOP community.
