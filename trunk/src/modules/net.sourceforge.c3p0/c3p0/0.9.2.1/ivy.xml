            <p>
            c3p0 is an easy-to-use library for making traditional
            JDBC drivers "enterprise-ready" by augmenting them with
            functionality defined by the jdbc3 spec and the optional
            extensions to jdbc2. In particular, c3p0 provides several
            useful services:
            <ul>
            <li>Classes which adapt traditional DriverManager-based JDBC
            drivers to the new javax.sql.DataSource scheme for acquiring
            database Connections.</li>
            <li>Transparent pooling of Connection and PreparedStatements
            behind DataSources which can "wrap" around traditional
            drivers or arbitrary unpooled DataSources.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            The library tries hard to get the details right:
            <ul>
            <li>c3p0 DataSources are both Referenceable and Serializable,
            and are thus suitable for binding to a wide-variety of
            JNDI-based naming services.</li>
            <li>Statement and ResultSets are carefully cleaned up
            when pooled Connections and Statements are checked in,
            to prevent resource- exhaustion when clients use the lazy
            but common resource-management strategy of only cleaning up
            their Connections....</li>
            <li>The library adopts the approach defined by the JDBC
            2 and 3 specification (even where these conflict with the
            library author's preferences). DataSources are written in
            the JavaBean style, offering all the required and most of
            the optional properties (as well as some non-standard ones),
            and no-arg constructors. All JDBC-defined internal interfaces
            are implemented (ConnectionPoolDataSource, PooledConnection,
            ConnectionEvent-generating Connections, etc.) You can mix
            c3p0 classes with compliant third-party implementations
            (although not all c3p0 features will work with external
            implementations).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            c3p0 hopes to provide DataSource implementations more
            than suitable for use by high-volume "J2EE enterprise
            applications". Please provide feedback, bug-fixes, etc.!
