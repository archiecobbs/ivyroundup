            <p>The JSR-296 Swing Application Framework prototype implementation is a small set of
            Java classes that simplify building desktop applications. The prototype provides
            infrastructure that's common to most desktop applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application lifecyle, notably GUI startup and shutdown.</li>
                <li>Support for managing and loading resources, like strings, formatted messages,
                    images, colors, fonts, and other types common to desktop applications.</li>
                <li>Support for defining, managing, and binding Actions, including Actions
                    that run asynchronously (in the "background").</li>
                <li>Persistent session state: support for automatically and selectively saving
                    GUI state from one run of an application to the next.</li>
            </ul>
