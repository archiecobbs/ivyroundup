        <description homepage="http://java.net/projects/timingframework/">
        <p>
        The Timing Framework is a library for making Java animation and timing-based control easier. There are two articles on java.net that describe some of the fundamentals: <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/15/timing.html">Timing is Everything</a> and <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/03/16/time-again.html">Time Again</a>; these articles will serve as a good introduction to the framework, although some of the API particulars have changed since the articles were published.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note: The 1.0 version of this library is fully documented in chapters 14-15 of the book <a href="http://filthyrichclients.org/">Filthy Rich Clients</a>. So if you need something beyond the JavaDocs, examples, and source code found here, you might try that book. Okay, so it's a shameless plug for the book. But it's also the reality that I just haven't had time to document the latest version of the library in the past few months of finishing up the book. So look to the book for now, and look for more information on the project site eventually, when I get to it.<br/><br/>Note that InfoQ has posted most of <a href="http://www.infoq.com/resource/articles/filthy-rich-clients/en/resources/FilthyRichClients14_InfoQ.pdf">Chapter 14</a> online, which covers the core API of the framework, so that's a good place to start if you don't have the book handy.
