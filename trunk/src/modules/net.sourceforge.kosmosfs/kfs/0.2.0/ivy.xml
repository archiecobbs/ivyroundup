            <p>
                Web-scale applications require a scalable storage infrastructure to process vast amounts
                of data. CloudStore (formerly, Kosmos filesystem) is an open-source high performance 
                distributed filesystem designed to meet such an infrastructure need:
            </p>
            <p>
                CloudStore is implemented in C++ using standard system components such as STL,
                boost libraries, aio, log4cpp.
            </p>
            <p>
                CloudStore is integrated with Hadoop and Hypertable. This enables applications bult on
                those systems to seamlessly use CloudStore as the underlying data store.
