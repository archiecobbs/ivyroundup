        <p>
        MapDB is embedded database engine. It provides java collections backed by disk or memory database store.
        MapDB has excellent performance comparable to <code>java.util.HashMap</code> and other collections,
        but is not limited by GC. It is also very flexible engine with many storage backend, cache algorithms,
        and so on. And finally MapDB is pure-java single 400K JAR and only depends on JRE 6+ or Android 2.1+.
        </p>
