            In our continued commitment to interoperability, Microsoft
            has released the 4.0 version of the Microsoft JDBC Driver
            for SQL Server. The Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.0 for SQL
            Server download is available to all SQL Server users at
            no additional charge, and provides access to Microsoft®
            SQL Server® 2012, SQL Server 2008 R2, SQL Server 2008,
            SQL Server 2005, and SQL Azure from any Java application,
            application server, or Java-enabled applet. This is a Type
            4 JDBC driver that provides database connectivity through
            the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs)
            available in Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5 and 6.
