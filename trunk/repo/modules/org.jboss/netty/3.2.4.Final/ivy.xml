            <p>
            The Netty project is an effort to provide an asynchronous
            event-driven network application framework and tools for
            rapid development of maintainable high performance and
            high scalability protocol servers and clients.
            </p>

            <p>
            Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick
            and easy development of network applications such as protocol
            servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines
            network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.
            </p>

            <p>
            'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application
            will suffer from a maintainability or a performance
            issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences
            earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as
            FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy
            protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find a way
            to achieve ease of development, performance, stability,
            and flexibility without a compromise.
            </p>
