        <p>
        Javassist (<i>Java</i> programming <i>assistant</i>) is a
        load-time reflective system for Java. It is a class library for
        editing bytecodes in Java; it enables Java programs to define
        a new class at runtime and to modify a class file before the
        JVM loads it. Unlike other similar systems, Javassist provides
        source-level abstraction; programmers can modify a class file
        without detailed knowledge of the Java bytecode. They do not have
        to even write an inserted bytecode sequence; Javassist instead
        can compile a fragment of source text on line (for example,
        just a single statement). This ease of use is a unique feature
        of Javassit against other tools.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Aspect Oriented Programming:</b> Javassist can be a good tool
        for introducing new methods into a class and for inserting
        before/after/around advice at the both caller and callee sides.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Reflection:</b> One of applications of Javassist is runtime
        reflection; Javassist enables Java programs to use a metaobject
        that controls method calls on base-level objects. No specialized
        compiler or virtual machine are needed.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Remote method invocation:</b> Another application is remote method
        invocation. Javassist enables applets to call a method on a
        remote object running on the web server. Unlike the Java RMI,
        the programmer does not need a stub compiler such as <code>rmic</code>;
        the stub code is dynamically produced by Javassist.
