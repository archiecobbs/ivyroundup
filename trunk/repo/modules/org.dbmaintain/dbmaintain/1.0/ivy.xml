        <description homepage="http://www.dbmaintain.org/">
        <p>
        DbMaintain enables automatic roll-out of updates to a relational
        database. It brings database scripts into version control just
        like regular source code and can be used to transparently deploy
        databases from development to production. DbMaintain automates
        the part of the deployment which is most difficult to automate,
        opening the door for fully automated deployments in all stages of
        development.
        </p>
        <p>
        You no longer have to keep track of which database updates have
        been deployed on which database - DbMaintain does this for you.
        The database itself keeps track of the scripts that have been
        applied. A checksum is stored for each script that to ensure
        nothing has changed to the scripts that were already applied.
        </p>
        <p>
        Updates are performed incrementally: Only what has been changed
        since the last deployment is applied. Features such as repeatable
        scripts, postprocessing scripts, multi-database / database user
        support and support for patches turn DbMaintain into a complete
        solution for the enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
        DbMaintain integrates seamlessly with Unitils , an open source
        library for writing automated tests. With unitils you can easily
        test your application's database integration layer while you
        develop it, relying on DbMaintain for managing the test database.
