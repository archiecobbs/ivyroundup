        <p>
        BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable Java source interpreter with
        object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell
        dynamically executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common
        scripting conveniences such as loose types, commands, and method
        closures like those in Perl and JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <p>
        You can use BeanShell interactively for Java experimentation and
        debugging as well as to extend your applications in new ways.
        Scripting Java lends itself to a wide variety of applications
        including rapid prototyping, user scripting extension, rules engines,
        configuration, testing, dynamic deployment, embedded systems, and even
        Java education.
        </p>
        <p>
        BeanShell is small and embeddable, so you can call BeanShell from your
        Java applications to execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to
        provide extensibility in your applications. Alternatively, you can use
        standalone BeanShell scripts to manipulate Java applications; working
        with Java objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in
        Java and runs in the same VM as your application, you can freely pass
        references to "live" objects into scripts and return them as results.
        </p>
        <p>
        In short, BeanShell is dynamically interpreted Java, plus a scripting
        language and flexible environment all rolled into one clean package.
