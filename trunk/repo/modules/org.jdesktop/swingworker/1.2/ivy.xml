        <description homepage="https://swingworker.dev.java.net/">
            <p>SwingWorker is designed for situations where you need to have a long running task run in a
            background thread and provide updates to the UI either when done, or while processing.</p>

            <p>The  original SwingWorker version was published back in 1998 by Hans Muller and Kathy
            Walrath. Since that time a number of modified SwingWorkers were published. The  last
            version we are aware of was published by Joseph Bowbeer.</p>

            <p>Swing team got a number of request to include SwingWorker into the swing package.
            In jdk1.6 javax.swing.SwingWorker was introduced.</p>
