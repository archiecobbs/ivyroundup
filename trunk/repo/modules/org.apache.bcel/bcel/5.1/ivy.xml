        <p>
        The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a
        convenient possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary)
        Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes are represented
        by objects which contain all the symbolic information of the given
        class: methods, fields and byte code instructions, in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
        Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a
        program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again.
        An even more interesting application is the creation of classes from
        scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be
        also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
        and the format of Java .class files.
        </p>
        <p>
        BCEL contains a byte code verifier named JustIce, which usually gives
        you much better information about what's wrong with your code than the
        standard JVM message.
        </p>
        <p>
        BCEL is already being used successfully in several projects such as
        compilers, optimizers, obsfuscators, code generators and analysis
        tools. Unfortunately there hasn't been much development going on over
        the past few years. Feel free to help out or you might want to have a
        look into the ASM project at objectweb.
