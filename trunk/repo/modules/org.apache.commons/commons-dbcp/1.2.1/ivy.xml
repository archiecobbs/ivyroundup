            <p>
            Many Jakarta projects support interaction with a relational
            database. Creating a new connection for each user can be time
            consuming (often requiring multiple seconds of clock time),
            in order to perform a database transaction that might take
            milliseconds. Opening a connection per user can be unfeasible
            in a publicly-hosted Internet application where the number
            of simultaneous users can be very large. Accordingly,
            developers often wish to share a "pool" of open connections
            between all of the application's current users. The number
            of users actually performing a request at any given time is
            usually a very small percentage of the total number of active
            users, and during request processing is the only time that a
            database connection is required. The application itself logs
            into the DBMS, and handles any user account issues internally.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are several Database Connection Pools already available,
            both within Jakarta products and elsewhere. This Commons
            package provides an opportunity to coordinate the efforts
            required to create and maintain an efficient, feature-rich
            package under the ASF license.
            </p>

            <p>
            The commons-dbcp package relies on code in the commons-pool
            package to provide the underlying object pool mechanisms
            that it utilizes.
            </p>

            <p>
            Applications can use the commons-dbcp component
            directly or through the existing interface of
            their container / supporting framework. For example
            the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
            servlet container presents a DBCP DataSource as a JNDI
            Datasource. <a href="http://james.apache.org/">James</a>
            (Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server) has integrated DBCP
            into the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">Avalon</a>
            framework. A Avalon-style datasource is created by wrapping
            the DBCP implementation. The pooling logic of DBCP and the
            configuration found in Avalon's excalibur code is what was
            needed to create an integrated reliable DataSource.
