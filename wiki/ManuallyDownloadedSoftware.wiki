#summary List of software that cannot be downloaded without you manually clicking on something

Some software in Ivy !RoundUp cannot be downloaded directly from the Internet, due to the requirement that you must click to accept a license.

For these cases, the {{{packager.xml}}} files will look for the archive instead in {{{${java.io.tmpdir}.}}} You must download the archive files manually and put them there.

At the time of this writing, the following modules fall into this category:
