#summary List of software that cannot be downloaded without you manually clicking on something

Some software in Ivy !RoundUp cannot be downloaded directly from the Internet, due to the requirement that you must click to accept a license, browser cookie tracking, or whatever.

For these cases, the {{{packager.xml}}} files will look for the archive instead in {{{${java.io.tmpdir}.}}} On UNIX systems, this is normally {{{/tmp}}}. You must download the archive files manually and put them there.
