#summary How to build a normal Ivy repository using Ivy RoundUp

== Overview ==

The Ivy !RoundUp repository contains {{{ivy.xml}}} files but no actual artifacts. In place of artifacts, it has {{{builder.xml}}} files which describe how to download and (if necessary) extract artifacts on-demand.

However, it's easy to use these files to create a normal Ivy repository. How to do this is described here.

== Prerequisites ==

 # You must have a version of Ivy containing the *builder resolver* installed on your machine (see [http://code.google.com/p/ivyroundup/downloads/list Downloads]).
 # You'll need to [http://code.google.com/p/ivyroundup/source/checkout check out the source code] for Ivy !RoundUp using Subversion.
 # You'll need to be running on a UNIX-like O/S.
 # You'll need *ant* 1.6.2 or later.
 # (Optional) You'll need the [http://www.graphviz.org/ GraphViz] package installed to generate the dependency graph.

== Steps To Build Repository ==

Once you've satisfied the prerequisites:
 # Change into the top of the appropriate tree (e.g., *trunk/*).
 # Run *ant*.

After downloading all of the resources and resolving every module in Ivy !RoundUp, your completed "normal" repository will be in *build/repo-with-artifacts*.
