            <p>
            This tiny project provides a convenient, compact,
            pre-packaged and comprehensively documented suite of
            command line option parsers for the use of Java
            programmers. Initially, parsing compatible with GNU-style
            'getopt' is provided.
            </p>

            <p>
            Why use JArgs rather than other similar libraries?
            Because it's easy to use, thoroughly tested, well
            documented and liberally licenced (BSD licence so no
            GNU messiness).
            </p>

            <p>
            The package is small and without frills, but is
            functional, and contains code that has been in production
            use for quite some time.
            </p>
