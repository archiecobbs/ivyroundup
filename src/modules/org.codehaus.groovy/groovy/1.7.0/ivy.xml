        <li>is an agile and <b>dynamic language</b> for the <b>Java Virtual Machine</b></li>
        <li>builds upon the strengths of Java but has <b>additional power features</b>
            inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk</li>
        <li>makes <b>modern programming features</b> available to Java developers with
            <b>almost-zero learning curve</b></li>
        <li>supports <b>Domain-Specific Languages</b> and other compact syntax so your
            code becomes <b>easy to read and maintain</b></li>
        <li>makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its <b>powerful processing
            primitives</b>, OO abilities and an Ant DSL</li>
        <li>increases developer productivity by <b>reducing scaffolding code</b> when
            developing web, GUI, database or console applications</li>
        <li><b>simplifies testing</b> by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box</li>
        <li>seamlessly <b>integrates with all existing Java objects and libraries</b></li>
        <li>compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java</li>
        </ul>
