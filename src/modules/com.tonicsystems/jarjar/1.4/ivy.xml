        <p>
        <i>Jar Jar Links</i> is a utility that makes it easy to repackage
        Java libraries and embed them into your own distribution. This is
        useful for two reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>You can easily ship a single jar file with no external dependencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>You can avoid problems where your library depends on a specific version
            of a library, which may conflict with the dependencies of another library.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <strong>How does it work?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
        <i>Jar Jar Links</i> includes an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>
        task that extends the built-in <tt>jar</tt> task. The normal <tt>zipfileset</tt>
        element is used to embed jar files. A new rule element is
        added which uses wildcards patterns to rename the embedded
        class files. Bytecode transformation (via <a
        href="http://asm.objectweb.org/">ASM</a>) is used to change
        references to the renamed classes, and special handling is
        provided for moving resource files and transforming string
        literals.
