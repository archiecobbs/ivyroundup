            <p>
            StringTemplate is a java template engine for generating source code,
            web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output.

            StringTemplate is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators,
            multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization. 

            It evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com. 

            StringTemplate also generates the stringtemplate website: http://www.stringtemplate.org
            and powers the ANTLR v3 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic 
            is that unlike other engines, it strictly enforces model-view separation.

            Strict separation makes websites and code generators more flexible
            and maintainable; it also provides an excellent defense against malicious
            template authors.

            There are currently about 600 StringTemplate source downloads a month.
