            <p>
            iCal4j is a Java library used to read and
            write iCalendar data streams as defined in
            <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html">RFC2445</a>.
            The iCalendar standard provides a common data format used to store information about
            calendar-specific data such as events, appointments, to-do lists, etc.
            All of the popular calendaring tools, such as Lotus Notes, Outlook and Apple's iCal
            also support the iCalendar standard.
            </p>
            <p>
            Providing both a parser and an object model, iCal4j allows
            you to either modify existing iCalendar data or create new
            data models. Validation is also provided to ensure the
            data maintains a state consistent with the specification.
            </p>
