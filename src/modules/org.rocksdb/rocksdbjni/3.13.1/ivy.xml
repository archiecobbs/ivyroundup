            <p>
            RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering
            Team. It is built on earlier work on LevelDB by Sanjay Ghemawat
            (sanjay@google.com) and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)
            </p>

            <p>
            This code is a library that forms the core building block for a
            fast key value server, especially suited for storing data on flash
            drives. It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with
            flexible tradeoffs between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF),
            Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF) and Space-Amplification-Factor
            (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions, making it specially
            suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a single database.
            </p>
