            <p>
            The EventBus is a simple but powerful publish/subscribe
            API with annotations that allows POJOs to communicate with
            each other anywhere in a JVM without having to refer to each
            other. EventBus subscriptions are based on class semantics
            and/or string (topic) matching. The EventBus is fit for
            general purpose usage and has extensions for UI development.
