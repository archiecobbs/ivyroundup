         <p>HOWL is a logger implementation providing features required by the
         ObjectWeb JOTM project, with a public API that is generally usable by
         any Transaction Manager. HOWL uses unformatted binary logs to maximize
         performance and specifies a journalization API with methods necessary
         to support JOTM recovery operations.</p>

        <p>HOWL is intended to be used for logging of temporary data such as XA
        transaction events. HOWL is not a replacement for traditional log kits
        such as LOG4J and Java SE Logging.</p>
