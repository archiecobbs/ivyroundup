            The J2EE Management specification (JSR 077) includes standard
            mappings of the model to the Common Information Model (CIM),
            to an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB), and to the Java
            object model through a server resident Enterprise JavaBeans
            (EJB) component, known as the J2EE Management EJB Component
            (MEJB). The MEJB provides interoperable remote access to the
            model from any standard J2EE application.
