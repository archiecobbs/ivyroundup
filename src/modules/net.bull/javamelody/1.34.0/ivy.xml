        <b>The goal of JavaMelody is to monitor Java or Java EE applications 
        servers in QA and production environments.</b> It is not a tool to 
        simulate requests from users, it is a tool to measure and calculate 
        statistics on real operation of an application depending on the usage 
        of the application by users.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>JavaMelody is opensource (LGPL) and production ready: in production 
        in an application of 25 person years.</b> JavaMelody is easy to 
        integrate in most applications and is lightweight (no profiling and no 
        database).
