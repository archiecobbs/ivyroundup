        <description homepage="http://args4j.kohsuke.org/">
        <p>args4j is a small Java class library that makes it easy to parse command line options/arguments in your CUI application.</p>

        <ul>
                <li>It makes the command line parsing very easy by using annotations.</li>
                <li>You can generate the usage screen very easily.</li>
                <li>You can generate HTML/XML that lists all options for your documentation.</li>
                <li>Fully supports localization.</li>
                <li>It is designed to parse <tt>javac</tt> like options (as opposed to GNU-style where <code>ls -lR</code> is considered to have two options <tt>l</tt> and <tt>R</tt>.)</li>
                <li>It is licensed under the MIT license</li>.
