        <p>
        JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries
        (DLLs on Windows) without writing anything but Java code--no JNI
        or native code is required. This functionality is comparable to
        Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes. Access is dynamic
        at runtime without code generation.
        </p>

        <p>
        JNA allows you to call directly into native functions using
        natural Java method invocation. The Java call looks just like
        it does in native code. Most calls require no special handling
        or configuration; no boilerplate or generated code is required.
        </p>

        <p>
        The JNA library uses a small native library stub to dynamically
        invoke native code. The developer uses a Java interface
        to describe functions and structures in the target native
        library. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of native
        platform features without incurring the high overhead of
        configuring and building JNI code for multiple platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
        While some attention is paid to performance, correctness and
        ease of use take priority.

        The <a href="http://jna.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/index.html">JavaDoc is
        available online</a>, which includes detailed descriptions of JNA usage in
        different situations.
