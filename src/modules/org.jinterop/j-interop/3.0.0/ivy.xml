            <p>
            j-Interop is a Java Open Source library (under EPLv1.0) that
            implements the DCOM wire protocol (MSRPC) to enable development of
            Pure, Bi-Directional, Non-Native Java applications which can
            interoperate with any COM component.
            </p>

            <p>
            The implementation is itself purely in Java and does not use Java
            Native Interface (JNI) to provide COM access. This allows the library
            to be used from any Non-Windows platform.
            </p>

            <p>
            It comes with pre-implemented packages for automation. This includes
            support for IDispatch, ITypeInfo, and ITypeLib. For more flexibility
            (in the cases where automation is not supported), it provides an
            API set to directly invoke operations on a COM server.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another important feature is allowing full access and manipulation
            (C-R-U-D) of the Windows Registry in a platform independent manner.
            </p>

            <p>
            The implementation has been tested on all advanced Windows and
            Fedora platform(s) and displays upward compatibility from JRE 6.0.
            </p>
