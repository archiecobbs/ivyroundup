            <p>
            Java-Readline is a port of GNU Readline for Java. Or, to be
            more precise, it is a JNI-wrapper to Readline. It is distributed
            under the LGPL.
            </p>

            <p>
            Although Java-Readline is distributed under the LGPL, the
            underlying Readline library is GPL code. The consequence is,
            that any program linking with Java-Readline+Readline, will fall
            under the GPL.
            </p>

            <p>
            There is a Readline replacement called Editline with a more
            liberal license. Starting with version 0.6, you have the choice of
            linking against Editline. This version also features a fallback
            solution (System.in) for platforms without Readline or Editline
            support, making your programs portable again.
            </p>

            <p>
            The code should compile for every platform supporting the
            readline, history and termcap libraries.
            </p>
