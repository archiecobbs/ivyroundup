            <p>
            Ascape is an innovative tool for developing and exploring
            general-purpose agent-based models. It is designed to be
            flexible and powerful, but also approachable, easy to use and
            expressive. Models can be developed in Ascape using far less
            code than in other tools. Ascape models are easier to explore,
            and profound changes to the models can be made with minimal code
            changes. Ascape offers a broad array of modeling and visualization
            tools.
            </p>

            <p>
            A high-level framework supports complex model design, while
            end-user tools make it possible for non-programmers to explore
            many aspects of model dynamics. Ascape is written entirely in
            Java, and should run on any Java-enabled platform. Whether you
            are involved in academia, industry, or government, we hope that
            you will find that Ascape enables your efforts to exploit the
            profound insights agent-based models make possible.
