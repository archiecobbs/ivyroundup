            The standard Java libraries fail to provide enough methods
            for manipulation of its core classes. The Lang Component
            provides these extra methods.
            </p>

            <p>
            The Lang Component provides a host of helper utilities for
            the java.lang API, notably String manipulation methods,
            basic numerical methods, object reflection, creation and
            serialization, and System properties. Additionally it contains
            an inheritable enum type, an exception structure that supports
            multiple types of nested-Exceptions, basic enhancements to
            java.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help
            with building methods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.
