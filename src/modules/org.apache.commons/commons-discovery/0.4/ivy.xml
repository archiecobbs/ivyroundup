            <p>
            The Discovery component is about discovering, or finding,
            implementations for pluggable interfaces. . It provides facilities
            for instantiating classes in general, and for lifecycle management
            of singleton (factory) classes.
            </p>

            <p>
            Fundamentally, Discovery locates classes that implement a given
            Java interface. The discovery pattern, though not necessarily this
            package, is used in many projects including JAXP (SaxParserFactory
            and others) and commons-logging (LogFactory). By extracting
            this pattern, other projects can (re)use it and take advantage
            of improvements to the pattern as Discovery evolves.
            </p>

            <p>
            Discovery improves over previous implementations by establishing
            facilities for working within managed environments. These allow
            configuration and property overrides without appealing to the
            global System properties (which are scoped across an entire JVM).
