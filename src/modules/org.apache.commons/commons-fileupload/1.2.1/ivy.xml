           The Commons FileUpload package makes it easy to add robust, high-performance,
           file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.
           FileUpload parses HTTP requests which conform to RFC 1867, "Form-based File Upload in HTML".
           That is, if an HTTP request is submitted using the POST method, and with a content type of
           "multipart/form-data", then FileUpload can parse that request, and make the results
           available in a manner easily used by the caller.
