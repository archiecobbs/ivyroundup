        <p>
        The POI project consists of APIs for manipulating various file
        formats based upon Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format, and
        Office OpenXML format, using pure Java. In short, you can read and
        write MS Excel files using Java. In addition, you can read and write
        MS Word and MS PowerPoint files using Java. POI is your Java Excel
        solution (for Excel 97-2007). However, we have a complete API for
        porting other OLE 2 Compound Document formats and welcome others to
        participate.
        </p>
        <p>
        OLE 2 Compound Document Format based files include most Microsoft
        Office files such as XLS and DOC as well as MFC serialization API
        based file formats.
        </p>
        <p>
        Office OpenXML Format based files include the new (2007+) xml based
        file formats, including Microsoft office files such as XLSX, DOCX and
        PPTX.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a general policy we try to collaborate as much as possible with
        other projects to provide this functionality. Examples include:
        Cocoon for which there are serializers for HSSF; Open Office.org with
        whom we collaborate in documenting the XLS format; and Lucene for which
        we provide format interpretors. When practical, we donate components
        directly to those projects for POI-enabling them.
