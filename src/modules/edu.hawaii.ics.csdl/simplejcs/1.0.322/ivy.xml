SimpleJCS provides a wrapper around Apache JCS that preconfigures the system to support the following:
(1) Write-through caching with an indexed disk cache backing store;
(2) Default directory location (~/.simplejcs) for cache files;
(3) A shutdown hook to ensure that the backing index file is closed correctly on JVM exit;
(4) Typed keys and values;
(5) No need for a cache.ccf file; those values set programmatically;
