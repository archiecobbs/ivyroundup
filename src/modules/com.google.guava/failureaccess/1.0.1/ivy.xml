                Contains com.google.common.util.concurrent.internal.InternalFutureFailureAccess
                and InternalFutures. Most users will never need to use
                this artifact. Its classes is conceptually a part of
                Guava, but they're in this separate artifact so that
                Android libraries can use them without pulling in all of
                Guava (just as they can use ListenableFuture by depending
                on the listenablefuture artifact).
