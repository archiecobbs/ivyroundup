            <p>JmDNS is a Java implementation of multi-cast DNS and can be
            used for service registration and discovery in local area networks.
            JmDNS is fully compatible with
            <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/rendezvous/">Apple's Bonjour</a>.
            </p>
                  
            <p>The <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.zeroconf.org/">Zeroconf</a>
            working group is working towards zero configuration IP networking.
            <a chref="http://www.multicastdns.org">Multi-cast DNS</a> and
            <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org">DNS service discovery</a> provide a convient ways for 
            devices and services to register themselves, and to discover other network-based
            services without relying on centrally administered services.</p>
            
            <p>Java as a language is not appropriate for low-level network configuration,
            but it is very useful for service registration and discovery. JmDNS provides
            easy-to-use pure-Java mDNS implementation that runs on most JDK1.6 compatible VMs.</p>
            
            <p>The code is released under the Apache 2.0 license so that it can be freely
            incorporated into other products and services.</p>
