                This project publishes the Reference Implementation, Technology Compatibility Kit, examples
                and tools for JAIN-SIP-1.2 (JSR-32 maintenance release) and an SDP library that conforms to
                the public release of JSR 141 (JAIN-SDP) interfaces. JAIN-SIP is a low level Java API
                specification for SIP Signaling. The intended users of this project are SIP developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project publishes a full implementation of the RFC 3261 Specification and as well as
                suppport for several SIP RFCs.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can embed the JAIN-SIP stack in an applet, HTTP servlet or an application. JAIN-SIP can
                be used in SIP Proxy Servers (stateful and statelss) and in SIP User Agents. JAIN-SIP has
                been used to build a Session Border Controller, a few Softphones, a Resource Adapter for the
                JAVA Service Logic Execution Environment, a SIP Servlet Implementation and in a few Test tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                The JAIN-SIP Reference implementation is a product of the Advanced Networking Technologies
                Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - an agency of the
                United States Department of Commerce. The JAIN SIP RI, TCK and tools published by this
                project are in the public domain.
