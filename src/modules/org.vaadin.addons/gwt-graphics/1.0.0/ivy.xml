                The goal of the GWT Graphics library is to provide consistent cross-browser vector graphics
                library for Google Web Toolkit. Under the hood, the library uses to XML-based languages:
                SVG and VML. VML implementation is for Internet Explorer. Other browsers use SVG implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please note that GWT Graphics is a library for GWT. If you want to use it with Vaadin, you
                have to create your own Vaadin widget and use the library on the client-side.
            </p>

            <p>
            This version is for Vaadin 6.
