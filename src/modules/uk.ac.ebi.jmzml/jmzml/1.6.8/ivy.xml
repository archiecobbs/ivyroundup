            <p>
                jmzML provides a portable and lightweight JAXB-based
                implementation of the full mzML 1.1 standard format
                (note that the jmzML version number has no relation to
                the mzML version number), with considerable tweaks to
                make the processing of files memory efficient. In
                particular, mzML files are effectively indexed on the
                fly and used as swap files, with only requested snippets
                of data loaded from a file when accessing it. Additionally,
                internal references in the mzML XML are resolved
                automatically by jmzML, giving you direct access in the
                object model to entities that are only referenced by
                ID in the actual XML file.
            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from reading indexed and non-indexed mzML files,
                jmzML also allows writing of non-indexed mzML files.
            </p>

            <p>
                jmzML is written in 100% pure Java, and is made available
                under the permissive Apache2 open source license.
