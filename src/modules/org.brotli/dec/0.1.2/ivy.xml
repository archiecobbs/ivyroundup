            Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern
            variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio
            comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate
            but offers more dense compression.
