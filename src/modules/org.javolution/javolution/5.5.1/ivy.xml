            <p>
                Javolution real-time goals are simple: To make your application faster and more time predictable!
            </p>
            <p>
                That being accomplished through:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>High performance and time-deterministic (real-time) util / lang / text / io / xml base classes.</li>
                    <li>Context programming in order to achieve true separation of concerns (logging, performance, etc).</li>
                    <li>A testing framework addressing not only unit tests but also performance and regression tests as well.</li>
                    <li>Straightforward and low-level parallel computing capabilities with ConcurrentContext.</li>
                    <li>Struct and Union base classes for direct interfacing with native applications (e.g. C/C++).</li>
                    <li>World's fastest and first hard real-time XML marshalling/unmarshalling facility.</li>
                    <li>Simple yet flexible configuration management of your application.</li>
                </ul>
