            Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes. The design allows for 
            multiple calendar systems, while still providing a simple API. The 'default' calendar is the ISO8601 
            standard which is used by XML. The Gregorian, Julian, Buddhist, Coptic, Ethiopic and Islamic systems 
            are also included, and we welcome further additions. Supporting classes include time zone, duration, 
            format and parsing.
