            <p>
                The Java Advanced Imaging API extends the Java 2 platform by
                allowing sophisticated, high-performance image processing to
                be incorporated into Java applets and applications. It is a
                set of classes providing imaging functionality beyond that of
                Java 2D and the Java Foundation classes, though it is designed
                for compatibility with those APIs. This API implements a set
                of core image processing capabilities including image tiling,
                regions of interest, deferred execution and a set of core image
                processing operators, including many common point, area, and
                frequency domain operators.
