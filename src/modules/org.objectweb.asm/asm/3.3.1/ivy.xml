            ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and
            analysis framework. It can be used to modify existing
            classes or dynamically generate classes, directly in binary
            form. Provided common transformations and analysis algorithms
            allow to easily assemble custom complex transformations and
            code analysis tools.
            </p>

            <p>
            ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode
            frameworks, but it is focused on simplicity of use and
            performance. Because it was designed and implemented to be
            as small and as fast as possible, it makes it very attractive
            for using in dynamic systems<super>*</super>.

            <p>
            (*) ASM can of course be used in a static way too.
