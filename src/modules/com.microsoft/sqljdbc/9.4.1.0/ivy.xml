            <p>
            In our continued commitment to interoperability, Microsoft
            provides a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver for use
            with SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed
            Instance. The driver is available at no extra charge and provides
            Java database connectivity from any Java application, application
            server, or Java-enabled applet. This driver is a Type 4 JDBC
            driver that provides database connectivity through the standard
            JDBC application program interfaces (APIs).
            </p><p>
            The Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server has been tested against
            major application servers such as IBM WebSphere, and SAP NetWeaver.
            </p>
