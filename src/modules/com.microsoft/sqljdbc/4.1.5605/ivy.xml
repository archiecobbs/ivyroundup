            In our continued commitment to interoperability, Microsoft
            has released the 4.0 version of the Microsoft JDBC Driver

            Server download is available to all SQL Server users at
            no additional charge, and provides access to Microsoft®

            Server 2008, SQL Server 2005, and SQL Azure from any Java
            application, application server, or Java-enabled applet. Microsoft
            JDBC Driver 4.1 for SQL Server support begins with SQL Server 2008.
            This is a Type 4 JDBC driver that provides database connectivity through
            the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs)
            available in Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5, 6, and 7.
