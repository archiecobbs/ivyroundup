            <p>
            In our continued commitment to interoperability, Microsoft
            provides a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver for use
            with SQL Server, and Azure SQL Database. The driver is available
            at no additional charge and provides Java database connectivity
            from any Java application, application server, or Java-enabled
            applet. This driver is a Type 4 JDBC driver that provides database
            connectivity through the standard JDBC application program interfaces
            (APIs). The Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server has been tested
            against major application servers such as IBM WebSphere, and SAP NetWeaver.
