        Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
        scripting language support within Java applications, and access to
        Java objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to
        write JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the
        Java class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to
        be implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
        embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
        calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
        object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
        engines.
