            <p>
                Add-on contains server side wrapper component for OpenLayers Map. It also provides API's for different types of layers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The integration is built on its own GWT wrappers around OpenLayers javascript API.
                The GWT part is designed so that the addon can also be used in plain GWT applications without Vaadin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The add-on is evolving quite fast, thanks to numerous contributions. Some of the most essential features listed below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple base layers (E.g. WMS, TMS, Google maps, VirtualEarth (aka Bing), OpenStreetMap)</li>
                    <li>VectorLayer (Points, Areas, Lines, drawing, editing and styling either explicitly or via StyleMaps)</li>
                    <li>Popups</li>
                    <li>MarkerLayer (deprecated, users should start using VectorLayer instead. Also with plain OpenLayers)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The client side implementation is based on GWT's JavaScript overlays. Extending the API to any of OpenLayers features should be rather straightforward.
                Contributions, feature requests and bug reports are welcome via the Google code project page. Help or support via Vaadin forums or Pro support.
