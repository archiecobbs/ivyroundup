            <p>
            Vaadin JPAContainer is a data container for
            <a href="http://www.vaadin.com/">Vaadin</a> that uses the
            Java Persistence API 1.0 (JPA) for retrieving and storing
            data. It supports the most common features required by
            Java EE applications out of the box, such as lazy loading,
            advanced filtering, nested property names and caching.
