            JDOM is, quite simply, a Java representation of an XML
            document. JDOM provides a way to represent that document for
            easy and efficient reading, manipulation, and writing. It
            has a straightforward API, is a lightweight and fast, and is
            optimized for the Java programmer. It's an alternative to DOM
            and SAX, although it integrates well with both DOM and SAX.
