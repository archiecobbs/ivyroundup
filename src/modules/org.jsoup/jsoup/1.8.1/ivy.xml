            jsoup: Java HTML Parser
            </p>

            <p>
            jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API
            for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.
            </p>

            <p>
            jsoup implements the <a href="http://whatwg.org/html">WHATWG HTML5</a> specification,
            and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.
            <ul>
                <li>scrape and parse HTML from a URL, file, or string</li>
                <li>find and extract data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors</li>
                <li>manipulate the HTML elements, attributes, and text</li>
                <li>clean user-submitted content against a safe white-list, to prevent XSS attacks</li>
                <li>output tidy HTML</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and
            validating, to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.
            </p>
