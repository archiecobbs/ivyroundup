            HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used to build custom client and server side HTTP services with a minimal footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
            HttpCore is a set of components implementing the most fundamental aspects of the HTTP protocol that are nonetheless sufficient to develop full-featured client-side and server-side HTTP services with a minimal footprint.<br/>

            HttpCore has the following scope and goals:<br/>
            1. HttpCore Scope<ul>
                <li>A consistent API for building client / proxy / server side HTTP services</li>
                <li>A consistent API for building both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP services</li>
                <li>A set of low level components based on blocking (classic) and non-blocking (NIO) I/O models</li>
            </ul>
            2. HttpCore Goals<ul>
                <li>Implementation of the most fundamental HTTP transport aspects</li>
                <li>Balance between good performance and the clarity and expressiveness of API</li> 
                <li>Small (predictable) memory footprint</li>
                <li>Self contained library (no external dependencies beyond JRE)</li>
            </ul>
            3. What HttpCore is NOT<ul>
                <li>A replacement for HttpClient</li>
                <li>A replacement for a Servlet container or a competitor to the Servlet API</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
